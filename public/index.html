			<h1 >About</h1>
			<div >
			<p>Welcome to my digital resume! My name is Nathan Gerard-Bowen, and I&rsquo;m excited to share with you my skills, experience, and passion for Information Technology through this platform.</p>
<p>I am an Information Technology Specialist, with 3 years of experience in IT. Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding of Systems and Network Administration, and have honed my ability to quickly and efficiently find and resolve network and systems issues.</p>
<p>One of my strengths is my adaptability. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges, and I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can put my problem-solving skills to the test. I am also a strong communicator, and I believe that clear and concise communication is key to building successful relationships with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders.</p>
<p>In addition to my professional experience, I am pursuing a B.S. in Cloud Computing from Western Governors University, where I developed a strong foundation in Network Adminsistration and CyberSecurity. I also hold the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not working, you can find me cooking, playing music, and woodworking. I believe that having a healthy work-life balance is essential to my success, and I make it a priority to recharge my batteries so that I can come back to work refreshed and ready to take on new challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my digital resume. I hope that this platform gives you a comprehensive understanding of who I am and what I have to offer. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to <a href="mailto:nathangerardbowen@gmail.com">send me an email.</a> I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
